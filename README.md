## React.JS: Building the front-end

At first, I hated React 😁 thinking to myself what's the point!!
But now I see it, this is silly easy and powerfull too. I'm still missing
a lot of my magic when it comes to the design though, but I'll get there in no time 🦾.

This assignment took me around one hour, it was very easy to do since Boshra has already explained the concepts twice.
